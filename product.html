							<h2> Quick release skewer </h2>
							<h3> Invented by Tullio Campagnolo </h3>
					</header>
						<p>
							Quick release skewers are rods which are threaded at one end, with a cam assembly on the other. 
							This combines to make a lever operated cam system. The quick release mechanism was invented in 1927 by Tullio Campagnolo, who was an Italian bicycle racer. 
							He was frustrated when he needed to repair a apartment tire during a race, the weather had turned cold, and his hands were numb, so he could not operate the wingnuts which retained the wheel. 
							He had been well-placed prior to the puncture, but lost valuable time, so decided to develop a quick release skewer system which enables simple wheel removal in seconds.

							<h2> Usage </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							Stand on the left side of the bicycle.
							With the quick-release lever in the open position, insert the wheel into the dropouts. 
							A front wheel, or a rear wheel on a frame with vertical dropouts or adjuster screws, should go all the way into the dropout slots. 
							A rear wheel on a bicycle with a derailer adapter claw should go all the way into the adapter claw on the right side. 
							Gravity slides the wheel and frame together if the wheel is resting on the ground, or if the bicycle is upside down.

							<h2> Problems this innovation solves </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							This is probably the biggest benefit for the average cyclist. 
							Thru axles improve safety by making it nearly impossible for the front wheel to come out of the dropouts while you’re moving. 
							The dropouts can’t lift off of the axles vertically because they have holes instead of a u-shaped slots.
							In other words, the dropout completely surrounds the axle. Thru axles also screw into the dropout, forming a much more secure connection.
							This design prevents disc brakes from ejecting the axle under heavy braking force. 
							Thru axles also make the fork more robust and less likely to fail.
							The axles themselves are unlikely to break because they are thicker and stronger. 
							Finally, the axles are less likely to come loose after being improperly tightened.
							All of these features improve safety. I’ll outline each point in more detail in this section.

							<h2> Who's using this </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							Most everyone who rides a bike should be familiar with the quick release skewer as it’s used on most bikes.  
							It is great if you have to change a flat on the road as it limits the number of tools you have to carry.  
							It is also great if you need to remove a front tire to throw it in your car. 
							It is definitely one of bikes greatest inventions.

							<h2> Thru axles are the replacement </h2>
					</header>
						<p>
							When downhillers starting popping out wheels and snapping skewers, they knew the QR was a problem.
							So instead of u-shaped dropouts, they designed dropouts with holes and beefed up the axle.
							The thru axle threads directly through the fork holes and the wheel hub.
							This makes it nearly impossible for the wheel to detach. 
							With a thicker axle bolted directly onto the bike, strength and stability are greatly improved. 
							The end result is a stiffer front end and the elimination of brake rub.
							Plus, by adding a camming mechanism (like the QR lever) you can still remove your wheel quickly.

						<p>
							Buying your thru-axels now will give you a two year guarantee by our company.
							we will be installing it for you and best of all we will give the you a spare on for free.
							the open road waits for you to leave your tread marks on it. Never again stranded for hours
							to change a single tyre and it all starts with a few button presses.
