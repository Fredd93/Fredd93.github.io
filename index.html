						<p class="Paragraphs">
							From one slice of misfortune, an empire was built. When Italian racing cyclist Tullio Campagnolo found himself struggling in a race in the cold back in 1927 after being unable to remove his rear wheel due to numb hands, he vowed to come up with a better system than wingnuts for holding the wheel in place.
							Three years later he had designed the quick-release skewer. The original design was not much different to the ones we use today: a steel skewer through a hollow axle with a nut at one end and a cam lever at the other.
							Just like today, flipping the lever allowed the wheel to be removed and replaced in a fraction of the time it had previously taken. For the pros, this meant speedy mid-race changes. For the rest of us, quicker and easier roadside repairs, even if thru-axles are now becoming commonplace on road bikes with disc brakes.

						</a>
						<p class="Paragraphs">
							In 1984, Look launched the first successful clipless pedals. Called the PP65, the pedal utilised technology the French firm was already using in its ski bindings, to revolutionise the crucial component that delivers your power to the bicycle.
							So successful was the Look concept, using a cleat on the sole of the shoe that clips into a spring-loaded mechanism on the back of the pedal, that it has become an industry standard, with the great majority of clipless pedal systems from other companies resembling Look’s design – even if materials have changed in the last three decades.
							Earlier attempts at a toe-clip-free pedal were seen as unsafe for road use, but after Look changed the game – and Bernard Hinault won the 1985 Tour de France on his PP65s – we never looked back.

						<p class="Paragraphs">
							It could well be argued that the cycle computer itself changed the face of cycling, giving us an increasing amount of information from speed through to heart rate at our fingertips. But the introduction of the GPS bike computer has taken things to a whole new level to the point where riding without one is almost a statement.
							The giant on the scene is Garmin, which launched the first in its series of Edge cycle computers back in 2000, though Wahoo has since challenged Garmin’s title.
							Not only can GPS devices track a wealth of ride information without the need for a magnet on your wheel and sensor on your fork, but by linking to the internet they enable you to share that data.
							Since the arrival of Strava, this has made every ride a competitive ride for those who are so inclined to competing – with others or their own previous times – on segment leaderboards.
							GPS technology also allows for many cycling computers to act as navigators, meaning we can plot or download routes on our computers and then follow them without getting lost. Hopefully.

						<li class="asidetitles">Electricization:</li>
							<p>Because electric bicycles (e-Bikes), save energy, reduce carbon emissions, are low-polluting, simple to operate, labor-saving, and do not require a driver's license, they have gradually become a new choice for people's means of transportation.</p>
						<li class="asidetitles">Smart Bikes:</li>
							<p>The introduction of intelligent design to E-Bikes has been a key to attracting consumers. Along with the E-life developing around us, the bicycle industry is developing automatic and intelligent bikes with the potential to influence many of our walks of life.</p>
						<li class="asidetitles">Community sharing:</li>
						<p>As bicycle design moves more and more towards intelligence, riders hope to use intelligent networking as a community sharing tool to enjoy a more efficient riding lifestyle and to promote the formation of a new status quo of shared services in the bicycle industry.</p>
						<li class="asidetitles">Customization:</li>
						<p>Electrification and intelligence development depend on science and technology, but the design and development of customized bicycle products is also a key for bicycle brands to win new markets.</p>
						<li class="asidetitles">Globalization:</li>
						<p>Besides the intensified competition in the global bicycle industry, the US-China trade war has had a global impact on Taiwan's bicycle industry.</p>
